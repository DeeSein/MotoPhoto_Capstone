# MotoPhoto_Capstone
This is my Capstone project 

Description: Create a simple WordPress website hosted on AWS that serves as a personal blog to share your motorcycle adventures and photography. The site will feature blog posts, photo galleries, and a contact page. Infrastructure will be managed using Terraform.
